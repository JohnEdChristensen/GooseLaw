## Why I work in tech in the first place

I was drawn to software development becaues of its a powerful tool. I, like most people, want to make the world a better. Software plays a huge role in our lives and making better software can make our lives better.

### "Better" in what way?

## The Good (past)
Right out of college I got a

I'm a little obsessed about optimizing things. The more I can increase my output (of a possitive good impact on the world, that's how I default to placing value) while maintaining healthy level of input (Healthy = a sustainable and joyful, effort)

Software dev I think enables that for me.

I went to Epic. I was at some point satisfied with these being a high impact career. Epic was not perfect, but I could push it in good directions in my own small way.

## The Bad (past)
But the software sucks. I hate useing it, and end users hate using it. This isn't just a dig at epic, Epic is leagues ahead in many regards to all the competition, but Epic and It's competition are not competing to make the most loved softaware. They are all competing to make the most profitable software.

Profits > Employee happiness

You aren't going to love software that also evals your worth in a companies eyes.
You aren't going to love software that's trying to extract as much value as it can out of you. Epic brags about its efficiency packing tools to remove all gaps from inbetween appts. Hospitals that used to only do 12 CTs a day are now doing 16 CTs a day! Of course the CT Tech doesn't love epic software. It increased the pace of their work by 33%.

Epic brags about it's nurse scheduling software that can track everything that a nurse has done throughout the day. 
I've sat in on meetings with hospital execs telling us that they need support for real time tracking of where every patient, nurse, and CT tech are at all times to maximize patient throughput. 

Of course the users of the software aren't going to love the tool that holds them accountable to the ideals that capitalism requires of those that care for our health. The patient is paying a huge amount, and the hospital is struggling financially. Clearly the issue is nurses taking too long lunch breaks and CT techs chatting with a patient before pushing them through the *machine*

## The Good (next)
I want to make software that people love. Software that leaves people better than they were before. Big tech companies are designed to maximize their profit. User happiness is not the incentive. Maximizing the value extracted from the user is heavily incentivized.

You'll even be part of experimetse (A/B testing) to figure out what experimental new feature extracts the most from the users.

Open source is a clear line in the sand where developers are committed to providing more benefit than cost to users. Costs can't (or are much harder to ) be hidden from users. Free isn't free outside of foss.

When comparing writing software
I want to figure out how to make software and a living at the same time.
