## "Willing to work in a fast paced environment" 
My chest constricts at the thought of actually getting the job before I even finish reading the listing. Is this code for "we will extract every bit of value out of you"? What if I can't handle it? What if everything just requires more than I'm capable of giving.

Some could say I burned out of my first job. Many do say that my previous and first employer is notorious for hiring moderately ambitous people fresh out of college, and burning them out in 1 to 5 years. It's all worth it though, because they graciously offer a 1 month paid sabatical after 5 years. Most don't make it that long though. I only lasted ~3.5 years.

I voiced my concerns. alot. I will probably always remember a specific all team meeting where I voiced my frustration with being overworked, and had a collection of barcharts showing that our team's frequency of bug fixes that begat more bugs was among the highest in the company. We were moving too fast and breaking to many things. 

I explained to my team (including my boss/ bosses boss/ bosses bosses boss) that I felt forced between 
1. stay late, or work through the weekened yet again, ensuring that my "critical" bug fix isn't going to accidentally break something else.
2. Ship it and go home.
 
Decision 1 reliably errodes to decision 2 after a few weeks/months of consistent pressure.

## It's not your fault
What follows is hard for me to say about myself; there is a perpetual nagging thought in the back of my head vehemntly arguing that it doesn't apply to me. Since it's much easier to beleive about othe people, I'll just say that instead.

You don't have to work so hard that you crumble. You don't need to "just try harder" and feel constant guilt for failing to meet impossible deadlines.

Your failure to meet the impossible demands of captialism are not a personal failing. 


## "Willing to work in a fast paced environment"

What if they treat me the same as <past company>. What if I just can't handle it. Even if this new company is more moral (let's say they are a non-profit), what if it's even worse because it's now **mission based**. What if I have an even stronger sense of failure when I don't measure up?

To pull myself out of these spiraling thoughts, I want to consider what my dream organization would respond to these concerns.

The interviewer at this ideal organization might responded:

Here at "Do Good Things .inc" we have two primary goals
1. <insert compelling mission to improve the world in a classic non-profit sense, reducing global inequity in some sense> 
2. creating a healthy work life balance to model how human beings should be treated at work. 

These endeavors are both investments. They have immediate positive effects today, in the lives of the people our organization helps, and the lives of our employees. But we are also playing the long game. 

We want future generations to live lives that aren't dominated by soul sucking work. We don't want to future generations to spend their lives in frantic "fast paced environements".Their work life progresses at a productive and kind pace. It leaves them with ample energy to live/enjoy/mindfully experience/live fully the parts of life they find most meaningful.

## Competing values

The virtue of hardwork is deeply instilled in me. I cringe at the thought of anyone viewing me anywhere adjacent to laziness. The key to a good life is hardwork. I'm starting to realize the pendulum can swing too far. This can't be the only key to a good life, at least not for me. And it's not the only key that I want future generations to apply. 

I want to do good work at kind pace. Based on my past experiences, I'm scared that might be a difficult job to find. 

I don't want to live in a world where this is difficult to find. Calling out employers for pressuring me work too hard is really difficult for me to do. The voice in the back of my head screams that I'm the problem. The voice doesn't mind saying it for other people though.

You should be able to do good work at a kind pace. If it's hard for you to give yourself this grace, then just do what I'm doing.

Call out explotive work as an altruistic act. If you can't do it for yourself, then at least do it for the sake of others.
